# Software Design and Architecture

## Course Overview
This course introduced issues, techniques, strategies, representations, and patterns used to implement software systems, with an emphasis on the design and implementation of system-level software, large architectural models for System-On-Chip systems, Electronic-Design-Automation tool flows, and embedded systems.

Lab work for Software Design and Architecture accomplished using Java, Netbeans IDE and Apache Tomcat. Feel free to reference, but avoid copying.

In-depth exploration of critical aspects related to the implementation of software systems. Emphasizing the design and execution of system-level software, the delving into advanced topics such as large architectural models for System-On-Chip systems, Electronic-Design-Automation tool flows, and embedded systems. Gaining insights into issues, techniques, strategies, and prevalent patterns essential for crafting robust and efficient software systems.
